<h1>Work History</h1>

<p>I currently work at the <a href="https://www.fortsmithschools.org/">Fort Smith Public Schools</a> 
as a Technology Technician.I have been at this job for 5 years now. I have been in charge of implamenting 
4,000 chromebooks to 4 different Jr High schools in the district. I am resonsable
for upkeep and repair on these Chromebooks.I was also in charge of making OS image 
files for ASUS and HP Netbooks. When I started working at the district the repair 
times for Netbooks was 2-3 weeks. After being hired I was able to take the reapair 
times down to 2-7 days.</p>

I have been working with them since 2011. While with 
Old Fort I have over seen the upgrade of Windows Server 2012 to Windows Server 2016. 
Also we have added HP thin client machines and network printers. Thanks to being 
hired I have helped cost cost by repairing machines when they go down instead of 
the company purchasing new machines.</p> 

<p>Before I started at the district, I used to work at Walmart Supercenter her in 
Fort Smith for 5 years. I started as a cashier/cart pusher in 2008. After doing that for about
