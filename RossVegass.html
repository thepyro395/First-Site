<p>Hello! Welcome to my first site. I know it's not much, but its a good starting point.
I hope to do more with this the more I learn. I hope to add more images of stuff I have worked on.
I want to make this a good site to display screenshots of my other work. I also want this to link
to my GitHub account so that people can see more of what I've been working on in my spare time.
I hope to use this as a resume style site. So please, have a look around and enjoy what I have done as a start.</p>
<p>Please contact me at <a href="mailto:david.fielder@hotmail.com>david.fielder@hotmail.com</a>
I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
