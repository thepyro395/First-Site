<h1>College</h1>

<p>I went to the University of Arkansas at Fort Smith. 
Here I studied Information Technology with an emphasis on Programming.
I learned many different languages and practices.</p>

<p>One of the main langauges we focused on at the UofA-FS was Java.
We did most of our coding with java. We also did a bit of C# and .Net
in a few of my classes. We also covered COBOL and assembler.</p>
