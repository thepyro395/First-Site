# First-Site
This is where I am going to store my first site that I am working on now. I plan to build this as a resume site.

I have added my main page, project page, and contact page to this project. 

Update: Pages were updated to add the address tag at the bottom so my information is present the whole time. Also had navigation tabs at the bottom of each page for quick navigation. 

Update: I pulled the inline stlyes out and made a stylesheet for them. I feel that this will be better way to manage my stlyes across mulitple different pages. I plan to do more styling of pages in the coming days while I try to find all my old programs and start to revamp them for display. As well as finishing this site and geting ohter projects uploaded to be used as a resume, I plan to start working on other sites and some other projects to help make myself more marketable to companies.
