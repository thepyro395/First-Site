# First-Site

This repo is for my first site I have been working on. I updated the old code with the newer stuff I have been working on lately. This included deleting a few old files and some old code and adding new files with new code and new content. I will continue to keep this up-to-date as working on this project evolves into my resume webpage. Thanks for taking a look and let me know if you find a mistake or if you know of any better pratices I should be using for my HTML/CSS pages.
